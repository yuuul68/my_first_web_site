<h2>JAVASCRIPT 이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="JAVASCRIPT5 spicification">JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated JS,</a>  is a <strong> language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,</strong> alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>

    <P>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</P>
